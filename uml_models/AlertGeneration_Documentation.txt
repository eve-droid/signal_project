The Alert Generation System monitors patients in the cardiovascular ward, alerting medical staff based on individualized thresholds. The system consists of several primary classes: AlertGenerator, Alert, ConcreteAlert, AlertManager, and AlertStorage.

AlertGenerator is the core class responsible for data processing. It continuously receives data streams from devices such as blood pressure monitors and blood saturation sensors. Each patient has a digital profile within the Cardiovascular Health Management System (CHMS), which includes alert thresholds and their history of alerts. The AlertGenerator compares incoming data against these thresholds. When a data point exceeds a threshold, it instantiates a ConcreteAlert object.

Alert is an interface that defines the structure and behavior of an alert object in the system. It includes methods to get the patient ID, the condition that triggered the alert, and the timestamp of the event. ConcreteAlert is a concrete implementation of the Alert interface, encapsulating all relevant information about the generated alert, such as the patientâ€™s ID, the condition, the specific threshold crossed, the current value, and the timestamp of the event.

AlertManager is responsible for managing the ConcreteAlert objects created by the AlertGenerator. It ensures that alerts are sent to the appropriate medical staff and/or devices. The AlertManager maintains a map of alerts for each patient, allowing quick action from doctors and nurses for patients in need.

AlertStorage is used by the AlertManager to store and retrieve alert data. It maintains a map of alert objects indexed by patient IDs, providing access to all alerts stored in the system.
