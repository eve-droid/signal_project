Data-Access layer UML class diagram documentation:

With data continuously streaming in from diverse sources, 
it is imperative that the system possesses the capability to effectively manage and interact with a wide array of data sources. 
This crucial flexibility is ensured by the robust Data-Access Layer system, which is equipped with three distinct listener classes: 
FileDataListener, WebSocketDataListener, and TCPDataListener. 
Each of these listener classes has been meticulously modelled to cater to their specific type of data source, 
thereby guaranteeing a seamless integration process. By adhering to the DataListener interface, 
these classes not only maintain uniformity across the system but also pave the way for effortless scalability, 
as the integration of a new class tailored to a new data source type can be seamlessly incorporated into the system.

Given the diverse nature of the data sources handled by the system, 
it becomes essential to first parse the incoming data before it can undergo further processing. 
The role of the DataParser class comes to the fore in overseeing this intricate parsing process, 
thereby enabling the subsequent processing and storage of the data by the DataSourceAdapter class within the system's framework. 
This orchestrated sequence of data handling ensures the smooth and efficient utilization of the varied data streams captured by the system, 
ultimately contributing to the system's overall operational efficacy and adaptability
