The Data Management System oversees the organization and retrieval of patient data within a healthcare monitoring framework. Comprising several key components, including DataParser, DataReader, DataStorage, Patient, and PatientRecord, this system ensures efficient data handling and accessibility.

DataParser is the primary data processing unit, responsible for interpreting incoming data streams and parsing them for further processing. It collaborates closely with DataReader, a vital interface defining the structure for reading and storing data into the system.

DataStorage serves as the central repository for patient records, organizing data by patient IDs. Its architecture ensures seamless addition and retrieval of patient-specific information, allowing access to medical records when needed.

Within the system, Patient represents individual patients, managing their medical records and providing essential functionalities for record retrieval and manipulation. PatientRecord encapsulates specific data points for each patient, including measurement values, record types, and timestamps, allowing for tracking of patient health metrics over time.

In summary, the Data Management System operates harmoniously to maintain a database of patient records, enabling healthcare professionals to monitor patient health effectively and make decisions based on real-time data insights.
