Patient Identificator UML class diagram documentation:

Data streaming from various sources is a critical component of modern healthcare systems, 
where accurate linking of each dataset to the corresponding patient profile is of paramount importance. 
The consequences of misidentification in this process can be dire, 
potentially leading to erroneous medical decisions that can compromise patient care. To address this challenge, 
the Patient Identifier System incorporates the PatientIdentifier class, 
which serves to correlate the unique Patient ID with the primary hospital database, ensuring precise data attribution. 
Overseeing this crucial task is the IdentityManager class, which meticulously scrutinizes the ID matching process 
for any irregularities or discrepancies that may arise.

Furthermore, the PatientRecord class plays a fundamental role in the system by encapsulating comprehensive details 
of the patient's medical history and essential identifying information, such as their name, date of birth, 
and other pertinent data vital for accurate treatment and patient identification. 
Both the PatientIdentifier and PatientRecord classes adhere to the Patient interface, 
thereby establishing a standardized framework for patient identification throughout the system. 
This unified approach not only facilitates seamless data integration and retrieval 
but also upholds the integrity and consistency of patient information within the healthcare ecosystem.
