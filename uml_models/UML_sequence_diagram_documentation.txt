UML sequence diagram documentation:

The monitors within the system constantly monitor data levels, and if any data exceeds the predetermined threshold, 
they promptly forward this information to the Alert generator for further analysis. 
The Alert generator then swiftly accesses the Data storage to fetch historical data, 
seeking out past incidents to gain a comprehensive understanding of the context and severity of the current situation. 
Once with this valuable information, the Alert generator proceeds to create a new alert. 
Once the alert is generated, it is promptly transmitted to the medical staff through a notification system. 
At this point, two possible courses of action are presented: the medical staff have the possibility to acknowledge the alert, 
attend to the patient, and then manually resolve the alert within the server, 
or alternatively, if the monitors indicate that the patient's condition has remained stable for the predefined period of time, 
the alert is automatically deemed resolved by the system. Subsequently, the alert is effectively eliminated from the system. 
To conclude the process, the alert generator dutifully updates the data storage to guarantee that all information remains current and accurate, ensuring an up to date system.
