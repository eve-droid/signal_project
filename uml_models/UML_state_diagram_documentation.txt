UML State Diagram documentation:

The system is designed to continuously monitor the data of patients, 
comparing it against predefined thresholds. 
If the system detects any patient data exceeding these thresholds, 
it generates an alert through the alert generator. 
Subsequently, a notification is promptly dispatched to alert the medical team 
of the presence of an anomaly in the condition of a patient under their care. 
  
Upon receiving the alert, the medical staff can take necessary actions to address the situation 
and provide appropriate treatment to the patient. Once the patient has been treated, 
the medical staff has the option to acknowledge the alert and confirm that the conditions prompting the alert no longer persist. 
In this case, the alert is manually resolved based on the assessment and intervention by the medical team. 
  
Alternatively, if the system detects that the patient's condition has stabilized for a predefined period, 
it can automatically resolve the alert without the need for manual intervention. 
This automated resolution is triggered when the system determines that the patient's data no longer exceeds the predefined thresholds, 
signifying an improvement in the patient's health status. 
  
Following the resolution of the alert, the system ensures the integrity of the data storage 
by updating the information to reflect the most current status of the patient. 
This process guarantees that the data storage remains accurate and up to date, 
providing healthcare providers with reliable information for ongoing patient care and monitoring.
